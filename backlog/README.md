# Backlog

Purpose: staging area for planning inputs (epics, tickets, short-term roadmap).

Boundary with docs:
- Finalized and materialized artifacts live under `docs/epics`, `docs/features`, `docs/stories`.
- Use `backlog/` for ideation and in-progress planning; move to `docs/` once approved.

Traceability:
- Keep links from backlog items to their materialized YAML/Markdown in `docs/` when promoted.
