# Copilot context

This repository is governed by explicit Muse contracts.

## Copilot guidance

- Do not modify files under `/contracts` without instruction.
- Follow user story and AI prompt formats in `/contracts`.
- Respect AI constraints in `/contracts/ai-constraints-policy.md`.
- Do not modify tests to make failures pass.
- Prefer explicit, readable code over abstractions.
- When unsure, add `TODO` comments instead of guessing.
