# Product Vision

## Working Title
Bridging the Platform–Customer Gap in Regulated Industries

## Core Hypothesis
There is a significant and growing disconnect between **platform engineers** and **customers** in large, highly regulated industries—particularly healthcare (and similarly government, finance, and defense).

This disconnect leads to:
- Misaligned requirements and over-engineered solutions
- Slower delivery and higher compliance risk
- Poor adoption, trust issues, and increased operational burden

## Vision
Muse is a product-owner-focused tool that turns governance-heavy documentation into an actionable, traceable delivery backlog by converting policy into Markdown, user stories, TODOs, and AI prompts—committed to Git as the system of record.
