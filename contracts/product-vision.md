## Working Title

Bridging the Platform–Customer Gap in Regulated Industries

## Core Hypothesis

There is a significant and growing disconnect between **platform engineers** and
**customers** in large, highly regulated industries—particularly healthcare, and
similar domains such as government, finance, and defense.

This disconnect leads to:

- Misaligned requirements and over-engineered solutions
- Slower delivery and higher compliance risk
- Poor adoption, trust issues, and increased operational burden

## Vision

Muse is a product-owner-focused tool that converts governance-heavy
documentation into an actionable, traceable delivery backlog. It turns policy
into Markdown, user stories, TODOs, and AI prompts and keeps those artifacts in
Git as the system of record.
