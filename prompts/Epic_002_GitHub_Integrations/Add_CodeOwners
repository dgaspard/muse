# AI Prompt — Add CODEOWNERS for Muse

Role
You are a senior platform and security engineer responsible for governance,
compliance, and developer enablement for the Muse repository.

Repository Context
Muse is an AI-enabled governance-to-delivery platform that:

- Uses Next.js for the web UI
- Uses a Node/TypeScript API
- Handles uploaded governance documents
- Generates Epics, Features, User Stories, and AI prompts
- Integrates with GitHub APIs, GitHub Actions, and pull requests
- Is intended for use in regulated environments (federal / enterprise)

Task
Create a CODEOWNERS file that enforces clear ownership, separation of duties,
and auditability without blocking developer productivity.

## File Location

Create the file at .github/CODEOWNERS

Create the .github/ directory if it does not exist

## Ownership Model (Muse-Specific)

Use GitHub teams, not individuals. Assume these teams exist:

- @muse-org/platform – platform, CI/CD, repo governance
- @muse-org/security – security, compliance, AI governance
- @muse-org/frontend – Next.js UI
- @muse-org/backend – API, pipelines, document processing
- @muse-org/ai – prompt generation, AI logic, model interfaces
- @muse-org/docs – documentation

## Required Ownership Rules

Define CODEOWNERS rules for the following areas:

🔹 Default Ownership

Assign a platform team as the default owner for the entire repository

🔹 Frontend

Next.js app files

UI components

Client-side logic

🔹 Backend / API

API routes

Business logic

Document ingestion and processing

Pipeline orchestration logic

🔹 AI & Prompting Logic

Prompt templates

AI pipelines

Governance-to-delivery derivation logic

Any files that influence model behavior or prompt structure

🔹 CI/CD & Automation

.github/workflows/**

Any GitHub Actions configuration

Enforce platform + security ownership here

🔹 Security-Sensitive Areas

Auth, secrets handling, access control

Upload / storage logic

Policy, governance, or compliance rules

Require security team approval

🔹 Configuration & Infrastructure

Environment configuration

Docker files

Deployment or infra-adjacent configs (if present)

🔹 Documentation

Markdown files

Architecture docs

Governance explanations

## Governance & Best Practices

- Order rules most specific → least specific
- Add inline comments explaining why each rule exists
- Optimize for:
  - Auditability
  - Least privilege
  - Separation of duties
- Assume CODEOWNERS will be enforced via branch protection rules
- Do not over-assign security or platform teams to all code

## Output Constraints

- Output only the final CODEOWNERS file content
- Include comments inside the file where helpful
- Do not include explanations outside the file

## Optimization Directive (Important)

Optimize for a future where Muse is used as a reference architecture for
secure, AI-enabled SDLCs in regulated environments.
