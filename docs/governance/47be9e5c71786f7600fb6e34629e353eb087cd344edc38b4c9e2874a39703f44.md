THE GUIDE TO PERSONNEL RECORDKEEPING
Chapter 1: General Personnel Recordkeeping Policies
Update 13, June 1st 2011 1-1
Chapter 1 General Personnel Recordkeeping Policies
Overview
This chapter describes general policies governing the creation, maintenance, and disposition of
records used to document human resource management programs established by the Office of
Personnel Management (OPM).
The Guide to Personnel Recordkeeping will state that agencies will recognize the format of the
official personnel folder as the official record. That format will be either paper or for those
agencies that have converted to an electronic format and that format has gone through the
appropriate verification and validation process, the record is recognized as the electronic official
personnel folder.
Regulation
Personnel recordkeeping regulations are found in part 293 of title 5, Code of Federal
Regulations. These regulations establish policies and minimum requirements governing the
creation, development, maintenance, processing, use, dissemination and safeguarding of the
personnel records OPM requires agencies maintain.
General Records Management
Coverage
These instructions refer to storing Official Personnel Folders (OPFs), whether in paper or
electronic format, the permanent records that follow an employee throughout his or her career.
The Official Personnel Folders are under OPM’s control although they are in the physical
custody of the employing agencies and virtual custody of those agencies that recognize the
electronic official personnel folder (eOPF) as the official record.
These instructions do not apply to agency personnel processing systems. These systems are
designed to support personnel operations, feed payroll systems, and meet managers’,
personnelists’, and employees’ needs for information necessary to manage day-to-day
operations. Agencies may create and store their internal, operational information as they choose,
subject to general National Archives and Record Administration (NARA) recordkeeping
guidance. These internal records are not a substitute for the official, permanent documentation
that constitutes the Official Personnel Folder

-- 5 of 112 --

THE GUIDE TO PERSONNEL RECORDKEEPING
Chapter 1: General Personnel Recordkeeping Policies
Update 13, June 1st 2011 1-2
Example: The payroll/ personnel system operated through National Finance Center
processes personnel actions, uses that information to process pay actions, and
stores personnel information for access by appropriate employees. The
National Finance Center system is not covered by these instructions. The
Standard Form 50 and other documents produced by the system become part
of the Official Personnel Folder covered by these instructions.
Creating Records
These instructions apply to recordkeeping, not to the process for creating the record. The
circumstances under which a record is created are defined in the appropriate program regulation
and guidance.
Example: These instructions cover filing Official Personnel Folder copies of health
benefits registration forms. The Office of Personnel Management manual,
FEHB: HANDBOOK, explains when to create a health benefits registration
form.
Agencies that want to create electronic versions of standard or optional forms must get approval
from the sponsoring agency. OPM is the sponsoring agency for most of the forms in the official
Personnel Folder.
Example: The Office of Personnel Management is the sponsoring agency for Standard
Form 50, “Notification of Personnel Action.”
Example: The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board is the sponsoring agency for
TSP-1, “Thrift Savings Plan Election Form.”
The sponsoring agency establishes procedures for approving electronic processing systems.
These systems allow records to be generated, approved, and stored by electronic means.
Program regulations or operational guidance are the usual sources for these procedures.
Example: Procedures creating electronic processing systems for the Standard Form 50,
“Notification of Personnel Action” are in the Office of Personnel Management
Operating Manual, THE GUIDE TO PROCESSING PERSONNEL
ACTIONS.
Definition: Records
Records include all papers, maps, photographs, machine-readable materials or other
documentation, regardless of physical form/virtual form (electronic), made or received by the
Government in connection with the transaction of public business and preserved as evidence of
decisions, operations, or other activities of the Government.

THE GUIDE TO PERSONNEL RECORDKEEPING
Chapter 1: General Personnel Recordkeeping Policies
Update 13, June 1st 2011 1-3
The NARA administers the Federal records management program as stated in 44 U.S.C. section
3101. NARA’s regulations on records creation, maintenance, and disposition are in Chapter XII
of title 36, Code of Federal Regulations.
Civilian personnel records are any records concerning an individual which are maintained and
used in the personnel management or personnel policy setting process. These include records that
relate to the supervision over, and management of, Federal civilian employees; records on the
general administration and operation of human resource management programs and functions; as
well as records that concern individual employees.
Examples:
Position classification correspondence
The Official Personnel Folder/eOPF
Adverse action case file
Creating Personnel Records
Personnel records may be created because they are required by:
statute or Executive Order
regulation
operational guidance from central management agencies
agency records management programs
Each Office program that requires agencies to create personnel records, which may be used in
making any determination about an individual, is responsible for establishing minimum
standards of accuracy, relevancy, necessity, timeliness, and completeness of the record that
would promote fairness to the individual in the determination, 5 U.S.C. 552a (e)(5). An agency
holding an OPF concerning one of its employees is the custodian of the OPF during the period
the person to whom it pertains is an employee of the agency and is responsible for the
maintenance of that record regardless of format or media employed.
Retention of Personnel Records
The NARA regulations in Title 36, Code of Federal Regulations, include procedures for
determining how long agencies must keep records and when they may dispose of records. NARA
issues General Records Schedules that provide authority to dispose of such records, generally on
a Government-wide basis. To cover records common to a number of agencies, General Records
Schedule 1 covers civilian personnel records and General Records Schedule 20, Electronic
Records.

THE GUIDE TO PERSONNEL RECORDKEEPING
Chapter 1: General Personnel Recordkeeping Policies
Update 13, June 1st 2011 1-4
Privacy Act Records
The Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a) applies to individual records maintained in
a “system of records,” meaning a group of records under the control of an agency. Information
is retrieved by the name or other particular identifier (for example, employee number) assigned
to the individual.
Example: The Privacy Act applies to the Official Personnel Folder.
Example: The Privacy Act does not apply to files on position classification standards
development.
Agencies that maintain systems of records must publish notices in the Federal Register
describing the records, their uses, and the ways people can access the records.
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) publishes Government-wide guidance
concerning the Privacy Act. OMB Circular A-130 describes agencies’ responsibilities for
implementing the reporting and publication requirements of the Privacy Act.
Government-wide Systems of Records
Agency must publish a notice in the Federal Register when it establishes or revises a system of
records. 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4). OPM publishes systems of records for a number of
Governmentwide human resource management functions. These are:
OPM/GOVT-1 General Personnel Records
OPM/GOVT-2 Employee Performance File System Records
OPM/GOVT-3 Records of Adverse Actions, Performance Based
Reduction in Grade and Removal Actions, and
Termination of Probationers
OPM/GOVT-5 Recruiting, Examining, and Placement Records
OPM/GOVT-6 Personnel Research and Test Validation Records
OPM/GOVT-7 Applicant Race, Sex, National Origin, and Disability Status
Records
OPM/GOVT-9 File on Position Classification Appeals, Job Grading Appeals, and
Retained Grade or Pay Appeals
OPM/GOVT-10 Employee Medical File System Records
These are OPM’s records, although they are in the physical custody of other agencies. OPM’s
regulations implementing the Privacy Act are in part 297 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations.
The notices that describe the Office’s systems of records, including the Governmentwide
systems of records, are published in the Federal Register.

THE GUIDE TO PERSONNEL RECORDKEEPING
Chapter 1: General Personnel Recordkeeping Policies
Update 13, June 1st 2011 1-5
Agency Records
Agencies may establish their own personnel recordkeeping requirements to meet special needs.
If an agency establishes a system of records as defined in the Privacy Act, the agency is
responsible for ensuring the Act’s requirements are met following OMB’s guidance. Note,
however, OMB Circular A-130 says “Agencies should not publish systems of records that
wholly or partly duplicate existing government-wide systems of records.”
Example: Life insurance coverage (FEGLI code) is contained in both the Official
Personnel Folder and agency payroll records. Thus, agency payroll records
may contain personnel information; but since agency payroll records are not
covered by OPM’s Governmentwide systems of records, only the FEGLI
election documentation in the OPF is within OPM’s system of records.
Central Personnel Data File (CPDF) and Enterprise Human Resources Integration data
warehouse’s Central Employee Record (CER) are part of OPM/Govt-1 system of records. CPDF
and CER are highly reliable sources of statistical data on the workforce of the Federal
government. However, the accuracy and completeness of each data element within the
individual records that comprise the aggregate files are not guaranteed, and should not be used as
a substitute for the Official Personnel Folder/eOPF in making personnel determinations or
decisions concerning individuals.
Safeguarding Personnel Records
General Protection
Agencies should have management controls to ensure personnel records:
adequately document human resource management operations;
are accurate and timely;
are protected against loss or unauthorized alteration;
document the employment history of individuals employed by the Federal
Government;
can be located when necessary;
are retained and disposed of as required by General Records Schedules 1.; and
secured against unauthorized access. For example, paper or microfiche/ microfilmed
personnel records subject to the Privacy Act should be stored in locked metal file
cabinets or in a secured room. Access to electronic records are limited to authorized
users through use of logins, passwords, access codes and entry logs. 5 CFR
293.106,107,108 provide additional guidance and requirements.

-- 9 of 112 --

THE GUIDE TO PERSONNEL RECORDKEEPING
Chapter 1: General Personnel Recordkeeping Policies
Update 13, June 1st 2011 1-6
Access to personnel records subject to the Privacy Act should be limited to those whose official
duties require such access. This limitation applies to paper, microfiche/ microfilm, and
electronic records. Agencies should establish procedures to allow employees or their designated
representatives’ access to their own records. These procedures should ensure the records remain
subject to the agency’s control at all times. Agencies must ensure those authorized to access
personnel records, subject to the Privacy Act, understand how to apply the Act’s restrictions on
disclosing information from systems of records. See Chapter 6 of this Guide for special
instructions on releasing information from personnel records.
Prior to transfer of a Personnel Folder (whether in a paper or electronic format) to an agency
under OPM’s recordkeeping authority, agencies must remove or conceal all Social Security
Numbers (SSNs) and other personally identifying information belonging to someone other than
the subject that are displayed on records in the Personnel Folder (i.e., lists covering more than
one employee in a personnel action) and provide a copy to the employee of the changed record.
Exceptions: Any SSNs for beneficiaries and assignees identified on FEGLI forms SF
2823, Designation of Beneficiary and RI 76-10, Assignment Federal
Employee’s Group Life Insurance Benefit; SF 2809 and SF 2810; and FEHB
or FEGLI-related documents of a legal or medical nature such as those
described in Section 3-D; Benefits (p. 3-19) must NOT have non-employee
SSNs redacted, as this information is crucial to payment of benefits.
In addition, agencies must guard against disclosure of personally identifying information (PII)
belonging to someone other than the subject of the personnel file that may occur when an
individual request access to his/her personnel files. Agencies must review a personnel file prior
to providing access to the subject of the file and take appropriate action such as removal or
concealment of SSNs and other PII.
Disciplinary Action
Any employee who discloses personal information from personnel records knowing that such a
disclosure is unauthorized may be subject to disciplinary action as well as criminal sanctions as
provided under the Privacy Act.
Interagency Personnel Records
Interagency personnel records are those transferred with the employee as he or she moves from
agency to agency. The three types of interagency personnel records are:
Official Personnel Folder (OPF)/eOPF
Employee performance records
Employee Medical Folder (EMF)

-- 10 of 112 --

THE GUIDE TO PERSONNEL RECORDKEEPING
Chapter 1: General Personnel Recordkeeping Policies
Update 13, June 1st 2011 1-7
Official Personnel Folder
The Official Personnel Folder (Standard Form 66) or its approved electronic equivalent is a file
containing records that cover an individual’s employment history. It covers Executive Branch
service under title 5, United States Code. The long-term records included in the file protect the
legal and financial rights of the Government and the employee.
Employee Performance Records
Employee performance records include ratings of record, supporting documentation for those
ratings, and any other performance-related material required by agency performance appraisal
system.
The employee performance records are covered by the Governmentwide system of records,
OPM/GOVT-2. Agencies may decide what records to maintain and where to store such records.
When an employee leaves (transfers to another agency or separates from Government), some
information from the employee performance records must be put in the Official Personnel
Folder. Chapter 7 of this Guide has instructions on transferring employee performance
information.
Employee Medical Folder
The Employee Medical Folder (EMF) is Standard Form 66-D. Records from the EMF are
transferred to long-term occupational medical records when an employee separates from the
agency. Occupational medical records are records that contain employment-related information
about an employee’s health status, including personal and occupational health histories and the
opinions and written evaluations generated in the course of diagnosis and/or employment-related
treatment/examinations by medical health care professionals and technicians.
Medical records described above must never be filed in the Official Personnel Folder.
Agencies decide what medical records to maintain and where to store such records during the
employee’s service with the agency. Agencies may use the Employee Medical Folder to store
medical records during the employee’s service but must use the Employee Medical Folder to
transfer long-term occupational medical records when the employee separates. The Employee
Medical Folder transferred to another agency may not include drug testing records created under
Executive Order 12564 or records relating to employee drug and alcohol abuse counseling or
treatment or other counseling programs conducted under chapter 79 of title 5, United States
Code. Refer to Chapter 7 of this Guide for instructions on transferring the Employee Medical
Folder.

-- 11 of 112 --

THE GUIDE TO PERSONNEL RECORDKEEPING
Chapter 1: General Personnel Recordkeeping Policies
Update 13, June 1st 2011 1-8
The Employee Medical Folder is part of the Governnmentwide system of records, OPM/GOVT-
10.
Other Federal Service
Federal service includes Government service outside of OPM’s recordkeeping authority.
Records documenting that service are not filed under the instructions in this Guide and are not
kept in an Official Personnel Folder. OPM has reached agreements to share files with a number
of agencies that create such records. Section 2-A of this Guide shows the agencies and types of
employment not under OPM’s recordkeeping authority. It also explains the procedures for
transferring records created outside OPM’s recordkeeping authority. When employment records
created under OPM’s recordkeeping authority are mixed in the same file with employment
records created outside OPM’s recordkeeping authority, they are generally kept in a Merged
Records Personnel Folder (Standard Form 66-C) or approved electronic equivalent.
Example: Employment with the General Accountability Office is outside OPM’s
recordkeeping authority.
Electronic Records
Electronic records are information recorded in a form only a computer can process. Electronic
formats include any media read by a computer.
Office of Personnel Management eOPF Requirements
The purpose of the electronic Official Personnel Folder (e-OPF) and the paper Official Personnel
Folder (OPF) is to document the employment history of individuals employed by the Federal
Government. The electronic Official Personnel Folder must be complete; that is, when
combined with any other documents the agency chooses to retain in paper, or is required by law
or regulation to be maintained in paper, it must contain all the information.
OPM requires that each agency ensures that electronic Official Personnel Folder systems
Be thoroughly documented.
Be able to produce legible paper copies of all records. These copies should be in
compliance with the Guide to Preparing Personnel Actions, Chapter 3, Subchapter 3 for
SFs 50 & 52. Other form copies should be in conformance with the requirements of the
program office that requires the collection and use of the information in accordance with
41 CFR subchapter B, Management and Use of Information and Records, part 101-11-
203 (b), Standard Forms and Optional Forms Management Program.*
Have access controls to ensure a high level of security and confidentiality.
Allow correction and removal of erroneous records under strict authorization controls.
Include backup and disaster recovery procedures.

THE GUIDE TO PERSONNEL RECORDKEEPING
Chapter 1: General Personnel Recordkeeping Policies
Update 13, June 1st 2011 1-9
Provide for regular recopying, reformatting, and other maintenance necessary to ensure
that the records will be retained and useable throughout its life cycle.
Identify information in a way that authorized users can retrieve and maintain the required
records.
*This is not to discourage the use of electronic summaries of information previously
provided on a form. It is to ensure the information captured by the summary meets
the requirements of the program office that requires the collection and use of the
information.
Approval Process for eOPF
Requests for approval to establish electronic Official Personnel Folders should describe how the
proposed system will meet requirements set by NARA, Office of Management and Budget
(OMB), and Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Offices should request approval to create
electronic Official Personnel Folders from:
Deputy Associate Director
Office of the Chief Information Officer
Office of Personnel Management
1900 E Street, NW.
Washington DC 20415-6000
e-mail: hrsystempolicy@opm.gov
An agency may create electronic Official Personnel Folders after OPM approves the system.
OPM will work with the National Archives and Records Administration to authorize retention of
the electronic Official Personnel Folder as the official record. Part of the process may include the
conversion of paper OPFs to the electronic format. The general standard for the converted
record is that it must be of a quality that is as legible as the paper original. This applies to the on
screen image as well as paper reproduction from an electronic image. After conversion the
agency must continue to maintain paper folders for the period specified in the approval.
Exceptions: The following documents must be initiated in paper:
RI 76-10, Assignment of Federal Employee’s Group Life Insurance
Standard Form 2823, Designation of Beneficiary under the Federal
Employee’s Group Life Insurance
Standard Form 3102, Federal Employees Retirement System
Designation of Beneficiary
Standard Form 2808, Designation of Beneficiary, CSRS
Regarding the witness signatures on the preceding documents, the document must be initiated in
paper with handwritten signatures. They may then be converted to an electronic format via
electronic scanning.

Standards
Electronic Official Personnel Folders must meet the National Archives and Records
Administration’s standards for electronic records. These standards are in part 1234 of title 36,
Code of Federal Regulations.
Security Requirements
The electronic Official Personnel Folder system must meet the security requirements established
under OMB Circular No. A-130. Copies of this circular may be obtained from:
Executive Office of the President
Publications Service, Suite G-2200
725 17th Street, NW.
Washington DC 20503
Transferring Electronic Official Personnel Folders (eOPF)
The last employing (losing) agency will provide access to the electronic folder in an appropriate
electronic format designated by the gaining agency or provide a paper format if the electronic
systems are not compatible or if the gaining agency is operating in a paper environment. The
losing agency, after completion of a transfer of an electronic personnel folder, must disable its
access to the electronic version of the personnel folder to ensure it complies with the
requirements of regulations implementing the Privacy Act at 5 CFR 297.401.
Electronic Signatures
This covers the use of electronic signatures on personnel documents except as specifically
excluded on Part C-2 of the Standard Form 52 and block 50 of the Standard Form 50. Guidance
on the use and approval for electronic signatures in Part C-2 of the Standard Form 52 and in
block 50 of the Standard Form 50 is found in Chapter 3 of the Guide to Processing Personnel
Actions.
For the purpose of this policy, an electronic signature is defined as:
A signature initiated from an electronically generated process.
Listed below are two examples of electronic signatures:
A computer data compilation of any symbol or series of symbols, executed, adopted, or
authorized by an individual to be the legally binding equivalent of the individual's
handwritten signature.

A data element associated with a message that identifies a person and indicates his or her
approval of the contents of the message.
The Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA), Public Law 105-277, requires agencies to
provide individuals or entities the option to submit information or transact with the agency
electronically and to maintain records electronically when practicable. GPEA specifically states
electronic records and their related electronic signatures are not to be denied legal effect,
validity, or enforceability merely because they are in electronic form.
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued guidance on the implementation of GPEA
and use of electronic signatures in Appendix II of OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal
Information Resources.
Agencies may institute the use of electronic signatures for personnel records, business
applications, and information collection whenever the use of electronic transactions is practicable
and:
the use is not prohibited by law or regulation;
the document containing the electronic signature is not required to be retained in paper
format; or the document is not on the following list of exclusions.
Electronic Signature Exclusions
SF 2823 Designation of Beneficiary under FEGLI Program*
SF 3102 Designation of Beneficiary FERS*
SF 2808 Designation of Beneficiary( CSRS)
RI 76-10 Assignment of Federal Employees, Group Life Insurance (FEGLI)
(must be witnessed)
*Regarding the witness signatures on the preceding documents, the document must be initiated
in paper with handwritten signatures. They may then be converted to an electronic format via
electronic scanning.
Signatures as Part of the Official Record
Agencies may accept both hand-written and electronic signatures as part of the official record.
Agencies may recognize official records in either electronic or paper format.
If the agency recognizes the official record in an electronic format, it may accept:
An electronic signature; or
A hand-written signature as a part of a document and convert the document (i.e. scan it)
into an accessible, reproducible, legible, quality approved electronic format. Once the
conversion has been completed, the contents of the document along with the signature are
recognized as the official record.

Update 13, June 1st 2011 1-12
If the agency recognizes the official record in paper format, it can accept the electronic or hand-
written signature as a part of a document and file the document on the appropriate side of the
official personnel folder.
Inquiries
Questions concerning the technical use of electronic signatures and alternatives should be
directed to the agency’s CIO. Other questions about the use of electronic signature for personnel
documents should be directed to:

while the employee is serving with the office that creates the microform and for transfer to the
next employing office or the National Personnel Records Center.
Microform Official Personnel Folders must meet NARA standards for microform records. These
standards are found in part 1230 of title 36, Code of Federal Regulations.
Offices planning to maintain microform Official Personnel Folders should obtain a copy of the

the microforms operations plan is approved, the office may create microform folders but must
continue to maintain paper folders for the period specified in the plan’s approval. At the end of
that period, the office must certify their microform system meets all requirements in the
operations plan. The microform folders will then be the official records.
Offices maintaining microform Official Personnel Folders as the official record will transfer
those microform records just as they would transfer paper records.
Reading Microforms
An office that receives a microform Official Personnel Folder must maintain that folder as the
official record. If the receiving office cannot effectively use the microform Official Personnel
Folder in its operating environment, it should contact the office that created the microform and
arrange to get paper copies of necessary documents. These paper copies are for the receiving
office’s internal use; they will not replace the official microform record.

Chapter 2: Establishing Personnel Record
Update 13, June 1st 2011 2-1
Chapter 2 Establishing Personnel Records
Overview
This chapter describes procedures for establishing interagency personnel records when an agency
hires an individual. Interagency personnel records include:
personnel folders
medical folders
performance records
General Rule
Each employee will have a single personnel folder which will document the entire period of
Federal civilian service. If long-term occupational medical records are created on the employee,
these records will be combined in a single medical folder that will be used for the entire period of
Federal civilian service. The procedures described in this chapter are designed to ensure all
appropriate interagency personnel records are available in a single folder.
Identifying Prior Federal Civilian Service
First Step
The first step in determining how to establish the appropriate records systems for a new
employee is to identify whether or not he or she has been previously employed in the Federal
civilian service. Records of such service are usually combined with records created during the
current period of employment.
Where to look
Review the employee’s application and the Standard Form 144, Statement of Prior Federal
Service to determine if he or she has been previously employed in the Federal civilian service.
Definition: Federal civilian service
Federal civilian service includes appointments with and without pay in the Executive,
Legislative, and Judicial branches of the Federal Government. For this purpose, it also includes
periods of volunteer service under section 3111 of title 5, United States Code documented on a
Standard Form 50.

-- 18 of 112 --

THE GUIDE TO PERSONNEL RECORDKEEPING
Chapter 2: Establishing Personnel Record
Update 13, June 1st 2011 2-2
There are periods of service that are not Federal civilian service but may be creditable for certain
purposes, such as annual leave accrual, reduction-in-force, and retirement.
Examples: military service, volunteer service with the Peace Corps or ACTION,
employment under Department of Agriculture county committees, work with
overseas broadcasting corporations.
Records covering these periods of service are retained by the agency or organization for which
the service was performed. The actual records of such service are not combined with personnel
records covering Federal civilian employment. Summaries or verification of such creditable
service are made part of the employee’s personnel folder as supporting documentation for
service credit or other similar determinations. Chapter 6 of the Operating Manual, THE GUIDE
TO PROCESSING PERSONNEL ACTIONS, and Chapter 20 of the Operating Manual, THE
CSRS AND FERS HANDBOOK FOR PERSONNEL AND PAYROLL OFFICES provide
guidance on verifying such service.
Requesting Records for Prior Service
Requesting records
When the employee begins work, the personnel office must request the personnel records for
new employees with prior Federal civilian service. Where and how to request prior service
records depends on the type of prior service the employee had and whether he or she is currently
a Federal employee.
National Personnel Records Center
Always contact the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) to make sure all prior service
records are filed together. The employee may not list all prior service in the application
documents; a former employer may have failed to check for all prior service records.
Request both personnel and medical folders.
Personnel Folder: Send a Standard Form 127, Request for Official Personnel Folder, in
duplicate, to request any personnel folder(s).
Employee Medical Folder: Send a Standard Form 184, Request for Employee Medical
Folder, to request any medical folder(s).

-- 19 of 112 --

THE GUIDE TO PERSONNEL RECORDKEEPING
Chapter 2: Establishing Personnel Record
Update 13, June 1st 2011 2-3
Send the requests to:
National Archives and Records Administration
National Personnel Records Center
1411 Boulder Boulevard
Valmeyer, IL. 62295
Note there are two separate forms to request both the personnel and medical folders.
Performance records transferred from agency to agency will be on the left side of the personnel
folder.
Previous or current employer
Records generally will be with the previous employer if the person:
Is or has been on that employer’s rolls within 90 days prior to the new appointment
Is receiving severance pay
Is on the previous employer’s reemployment priority list
Was last employed in the Foreign Service and has separated within the year prior to the
new appointment.
Send the previous employer a note requesting the personnel folder (including performance
records) and medical folder. Include a copy of the Standard Form 50, Notification of Personnel
Action, appointing the person. (If it is not available, use a copy of the Standard Form 52,
Request for Personnel Action or other approved document showing the appointment and
effective date).
Employers using transcript
Some employers not within OPM’s recordkeeping authority do not transfer personnel records.
These employers will provide a transcript of service and documents on benefits. The benefits
documents generally include the equivalent of the Official Personnel Folder copy of health
insurance, life insurance, retirement, and Thrift Savings Plan documents. If the employer has a
leave system similar to the civil service, the benefits documents may include information on the
employee’s leave balances. Request a transcript of service, benefits documents, and leave
balances, instead of requesting the personnel and medical folders from these employers.
Employers who provide transcripts service include:
Architect of the Capitol
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
Central Intelligence Agency

Establishing Folders
Performance records
Follow agency instructions to establish employee performance files. Performance records
transferred from a previous employer may be filed with performance records created in the
current agency. The General Records Schedules specifies performance records for non-Senior
Executive Service employees should be destroyed when 4 years old; for Senior Executive
Service employees, when 5 years old.
Medical records
Follow agency instructions to establish employee medical files. Medical records should be
transferred from previous employers in an Employee Medical Folder, Standard Form 66 D.
Agencies have the option to continue to use that folder for any medical records created during
the current period of employment. Regardless of how the records are stored during the
employee’s service, all long-term occupational medical records must be placed in a single
Employee Medical Folder when the employee leaves the agency. Chapter 7 contains information
on transferring medical records when an employee separates.
Personnel records
Personnel records that document an individual’s Federal career are placed in a single personnel
folder or eOPF. The type of folder to be used depends on the kinds of service the employee has.
There are three authorized personnel folders:
Official Personnel Folder, Standard Form 66
Merged Records Personnel Folder, Standard Form 66 C
Foreign Service Administrative Folder

-- 21 of 112 --

THE GUIDE TO PERSONNEL RECORDKEEPING
Chapter 2: Establishing Personnel Record
Update 13, June 1st 2011 2-5
Official Personnel Folder
The Standard Form 66, Official Personnel Folder must be used when:
All of the employee's Federal service is under OPM’s recordkeeping authority. (All
employment in the competitive service, Senior Executive Service, excepted service under
Schedule A, B or C is under the Office’s recordkeeping authority.); OR
Any service outside OPM’s recordkeeping authority is documented by a transcript.
Section 2-A lists service documented by a transcript rather than an exchange of records.
The Merged Records Personnel Folder
When the employee has service both under OPM’s recordkeeping authority and under one of the
personnel systems listed below. The Standard Form 66 C, Merged Records Personnel Folder
must be used instead of the Standard Form 66, Official Personnel Folder. Records under the
systems listed below are combined with records created under OPM's recordkeeping authority in
a single folder but each agency retains “ownership” of its records.
Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts
Civilian Intelligence Personnel Management System within the Department of Defense
Federal Judicial Center
Government Accountability Office
Library of Congress
Medical positions filled under title 38 United States Code within the Department of
Veterans Affairs

Transportation Security Administration
U.S. Postal Service
White House - Executive Office of the President
Section 2-A contains more information on how to identify records for personnel systems not
under OPM’s recordkeeping authority.
Foreign Service Folder
The Foreign Service (Administrative) Folder must be used when the employee has any Foreign
Service experience. Once a Foreign Service Folder has been created, all of the employee’s
personnel records are kept in that Folder. Section 2-A lists the agencies that make Foreign
Service appointments.

Update 13, June 1st 2011 2-6
Examples:
Employee held a Schedule B accepted appointment with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service prior to appointment to a competitive service position in the Internal Revenue
Service. Use the Official Personnel Folder since all service is under OPM’s
recordkeeping authority.
Employee held a competitive service position with the Bureau of Prisons and an excepted
service position with the Federal Bureau of Investigation prior to appointment in the
Senior Executive Service with the Forest Service. Use the Official Personnel Folder.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation retains its personnel records and provides a
transcript that becomes part of the Official Personnel Folder.
Employee of the General Accountability Office is hired by the Bureau of Prisons. Use a
Merged Records Personnel Folder. Service with the General Accountability Office since
October 1, 1980, is not under OPM ’s recordkeeping authority but the General
Accountability Office has agreed to transfer its personnel records using a Merged
Records Personnel Folder.
Foreign Service employee in Department of State is hired by the Internal Revenue
Service. Use a Foreign Service Folder. Foreign Service is not under OPM’s
recordkeeping authority but the Department of State has agreed to transfer its personnel
records using the Foreign Service Folder.
Schedule A employee in the Department of State is hired for a competitive service
position by the Internal Revenue Service. Use an Official Personnel Folder. Excepted
service (Schedule A) and competitive service employment are under OPM’s
recordkeeping authority.
Use the existing personnel folder
If there is an existing personnel folder, use it unless it is in poor condition. Check to make sure
the records are filed in the correct type of folder. Create a new folder if needed.
Folder label
The Official Personnel Folder, Merged Records Personnel Folder, and Employee Medical Folder
(Standard Forms 66, 66 C, and 66 D) all require the same type label. The position of the label on
the right side of the folder is indicated on the folder. The label must have the following three
items.
NAME: Type the employee's name exactly as it is on the Standard Form 50, Notification
of Personnel Action.
DATE OF BIRTH: Type the date of birth, month, day and year in six numerals with
dashes between day, month, and year.
Example: January 14, 1974 is typed 01-14-74.

SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER: Type the employee's social security number (SSN)
directly under the name. Show an SSN for all United States citizens and for all foreign
nationals serving in the 50 states and non-foreign areas listed in section 591.205 of title 5,
Code of Federal Regulations (5 CFR 591.205).
Example: DOE, JANE R.
SSN: 999-99-9999
Use "FNO" instead of the social security number for foreign nationals serving in locations other
than the 50 states or non-foreign areas listed in 5 CFR 591.205.
Do not make any marks or notations on the folder
Do not add any markings, notations, or tabs to the Official Personnel Folder, Merged Records
Personnel Folder, or Employee Medical Folder. Do not add any markings or notations on the
label. Only official codes authorized by the National Personnel Records Center are permitted on
the front of the folder.
When using a bar code labeling system, place the bar code label:
on the side of the folder containing the file label, but at the end opposite the employee's
name; or
on the back of the folder.
Reviewing and Combining Records
Rule
If the employee had prior Federal civilian service, records for that service must be combined
with records for the current period of employment in a single file or folder. Follow the
procedures below to review and combine records.
Example: The National Personnel Records Center sends two Official Personnel Folders
in response to a request for a new employee’s records. The records from these
two folders must be combined with the records created during the
appointment process into a single Official Personnel Folder.
Performance Records
The left side of the personnel folder (or the “Temporary” folder in eOPF) should contain the
performance records transferred from agency to agency. These records are:

-- 24 of 112 --

THE GUIDE TO PERSONNEL RECORDKEEPING
Chapter 2: Establishing Personnel Record
Update 13, June 1st 2011 2-8
Senior Executive Service: Annual summary ratings are five years old or less; any
appraisals prepared since the most recent annual summary rating; and performance plans
for each rating.
All Others: Ratings of record four years old or less. Ratings of record include the
evaluation of the employee’s performance against the elements and standards plus the
summary level, pattern, and ending date of the appraisal.
If the performance records are not in the folder and it appears the employee was subject to a
performance appraisal system, request the records from the former employer. Follow the
agency’s instructions for filing performance records.
Medical Records
Review records in the Employee Medical Folder to ensure they are in chronological order.
Combine these records with any medical records created during the appointment process.
Follow the agency’s instructions for filing medical records.
Personnel Records
Step 1 Action
Remove any documents transferred on the temporary or left side of the folder and follow agency
instructions for processing those documents.
Documents transferred on the temporary or left side of the folder include the performance
records, Record of Leave Data (Standard Form 1150) or equivalent record of leave balances, and
documentation of indebtedness to the health benefits fund for pay periods begun before
September 30, 1996.
Step 2 Action
Remove inappropriately filed documents.
Always remove any reference to race or ethnicity including the Standard Form 181, Race and
National Origin identification; the Standard Form 256, Self-identification of medical Disability;
and OPM form 1635, Welfare to Work Program.
Do not remove any other records in a merged Records Personal Folder or Foreign Service Folder
for periods of employment outside of OPM’s recordkeeping authority. Refer to Chapter 3 to
decide which documents should be filed in an Official Personnel Folder and in the portions of
Merged Records Personnel Folder or Foreign Service Folder dealing with employment under the
Office’s authority.

Employment Systems Outside the Office of Personnel Management’s
Recordkeeping Authority
Federal civilian service includes Government service under employment systems outside OPM’s
recordkeeping authority. Some of the agencies authorized to use these employment systems
have agreed to transfer their personnel records and mix those records with personnel records
created during periods of employment under OPM’s recordkeeping authority. Other agencies do
not transfer personnel records but do provide transcripts of service and other documentation (for
example, health insurance, life insurance, retirement, and Thrift Savings Plan documents).

Chapter 3 Filing Documents in the Personnel Folder
General Filing Procedures
Records are filed in the Official Personnel Folder to document events in an individual’s Federal
employment history that have long-term consequences for the employee and the Government.
Care should be exercised in filing documents correctly to ensure all documents pertaining to an
employee's rights and benefits are available in the personnel folder when needed.
Personnel folder documents are either long-term or temporary documents. Certain documents
must never be filed in the personnel folder.
Long-term Documents
Long-term documents are records kept for the life of the folder, usually 115 years from the
employee's date of birth. These documents are filed in chronological order on the right (or in the
“Permanent” folder in eOPF) side of the personnel folder.
Temporary Documents
Temporary documents are documents not kept for the life of the personnel folder. These
documents are filed on the left side (or in the “Temporary” folder in eOPF) of the folder.
Prohibited Documents
Prohibited documents are records that must never be replaced in a personnel folder. The
prohibition may come from statutes, such as the Privacy Act, or from regulation such as title 29,
Code of Federal Regulations.
Example: Standard Form 181, Race and National Origin Identification
Rescinded filing requirements
Rescinded filing requirements are document filing requirements cancelled as of a given date.
When filing requirements are rescinded, the document(s) should no longer be filed on the right
side of the personnel folder. See section 3-H for instructions on handling documents already on
file in the personnel folder.

Chapter 3: Filing Documents in the Personnel Folder
Update 13, June 1st 2011 3-2
Obsolete Forms
Specific forms may become obsolete because of legislative or procedural changes in human
resource programs. They may be replaced by other forms or documents. The entire process
under which the forms were created may be discontinued. Even though the form is obsolete, the
reason for keeping the form as a part of the employee’s history may still exist. The form may
still be filed appropriately as a long-term document in the personnel folder. Such obsolete forms
are listed in the sections of this chapter as documents authorized for long-term retention in the
personnel folder.
Procedures
Before filing documents in the personnel folder:
Step 1 Action
Make sure the document should be filed in the personnel folder. Some documents must never be
filed in the personnel folder. Other documents belong in case files rather than the personnel
folder. Once a document is entered within the OPF, it will not be altered or amended except
pursuant to law. (On occasion, OPM has granted agency requests to block out the first five digits
of the SSN and will continue to do so on a case-by-case basis.)
Reminder: Social Security Numbers (SSNs) and other personally identifiable information
belonging to someone other than the subject that are displayed on records in the Personnel Folder
must be removed or concealed ( i.e., lists covering more than one employee in a personnel
action), and the agency must provide a copy to the employee of the changed record
Step 2 Action
Place the document correctly on the right or left side and in chronological order.
Placement – Right Side
The right side (or in the “Permanent” folder in eOPF) of the personnel folder is reserved for
long-term documents. Only documents authorized by OPM may be placed on the right side of
the folder. These documents are listed in the sections in this chapter. Note these instructions
cover filing only. For information on when and how to create the document, refer to the
appropriate program guidance.

Update 13, June 1st 2011 3-3
Placement – Left Side
The left side (or in the “Temporary” folder in eOPF) of the personnel folder is used for
temporary documents. In a few cases, program guidance requires a document be filed on the left
side of the personnel folder. Those cases are listed in the sections in this chapter. Documents
not listed in the sections may be filed in the personnel folder at the agency’s option.
Agencies may choose to file other material on the left side of the folder as long as:
The document relates to the individual who is the subject of the folder. General
documentation of personnel operations is not appropriate for filing in the personnel
folder.
The document is a personnel record- not travel, payroll or financial records. Disclosure
records are not personnel records
OPM guidance does not prohibit filing the document in the folder. Prohibited documents
are listed in the sections in this chapter.
Other guidance does not require the materials be filed in separate files; for example,
documentation of health benefits enrollments under temporary continuation of coverage.
Examples of material to be filed on the left side:
Current position description;
Standard Form 1152, Designation of Beneficiary for Unpaid Compensation;
Letters of reprimand or caution.
Examples of material not to be filed on the left side:
Time and attendance reports;
Records on claims under the Federal Employee’s Compensation Act;
Equal Employment Opportunity complaint records.
When an employee leaves the agency, only specific temporary documents are transferred with
the personnel folder. These documents include performance information, notice of employee
indebtedness to health benefits fund, and records of leave data (Standard Form 1150). Chapter 7
contains more information on transferring personnel folders.
Chronological Order
Right hand side documents must be filed in the personnel folder in chronological order by
effective date. File the document with the more recent date on top of the document with the
earlier effective date. However, when:
forms have no effective date, file them by completion date; and
more than one form has the same effective date, file them in any order within the
effective date.

Section 3-H: Changes in Filing Requirements
Introduction
This Section contains the rules to follow when filing requirements change. Instructions on filing
specific documents as long-term records in the Official Personnel Folder may change whether or
not the requirements to prepare the document change. An obsolete form may continue to be filed
because it contains information important to the individual’s career history. Current forms may
no longer be filed as long-term records because the information they contain applies only to the
current agency. This Section covers changes in filing requirements for long-term (right side or
eOPF “Permanent” folder) Official Personnel Folder documents.
Example: The Immigration and Naturalization Service form I-9, “Employment
Eligibility Verification” was filed on the right side of the Official Personnel
Folder. Effective January 1997, the filing requirement was changed and the
form was no longer authorized as a right side document. The form and the
Immigration and Naturalization Service’s implementing instructions did not
change.
Document Removal
When the requirement to file a document as a long-term Official Personnel Folder record is
rescinded, agencies should issue instructions for handling the document. When appropriate, the
agency may file the document as a temporary or left hand side Official Personnel Folder record.
Agencies may also establish their own separate filing procedures.
Elimination of the long term Official Personnel Folder filing requirement is not authorization to
destroy the document. NARA issues instructions on records disposition. The General Records
Schedules provide disposal authorization for records common to a number of Federal agencies.
Agencies must follow these instructions on records disposition.

How to Reconstruct a Personnel Folder due to a Change in Gender
Identity
Place a notice of the reconstruction in the folder
A transcript of service serves as the notice of reconstruction due to the change of name and
gender. The transcript is to remain as the top document of the reconstructed portion in the
personnel folder. See Chapter 7 of this Guide for instructions on formatting a transcript of
service. For further policy guidance, please refer to Guidance Regarding the Employment of
Transgender Individuals in the Federal Workplace.
Upon the request of an employee to reconstruct his or her personnel folder to reflect a change in
gender identity, use the following procedures.
Step 1 Request and verify proper documentation from the employee.
Request that the employee submit acceptable evidence of identity in the new gender, if available,
and require evidence of the new name, if changed. State and foreign laws vary as to whether a
driver’s license or other State form of identification documents may be issued to reflect a gender
change. Possession of a valid passport in the employee's new name and gender is per se
acceptable evidence of the new name and gender, and no further evidence need be provided.
If evidence of change of gender in the identity documents is not obtainable because of state or
local requirements or any other reason, the personnel folder may still be reconstructed with the
employee's new name and gender to reflect a change in gender identity based on a medical
certification. To meet the medical certification requirement, the employee must obtain a signed
original statement, on office letterhead, from the attending medical physician (internist,
endocrinologist, gynecologist, urologist, or psychiatrist), that contains the following information:
Physician’s full name;
Medical license or certificate number;
Issuing state or other jurisdiction of medical license/certificate;
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) registration number assigned to the physician;
NOTE: If the attending physician does not have or provide a DEA number, the
employee’s request to reconstruct his or her personnel folder is to be
suspended for further clarification or verification of the physician’s bona
fides. Physicians in foreign countries, for example, would not have a DEA
number.
Address and telephone number of the physician;
Language stating that he/she is the attending physician for the employee and that he/she
has a doctor/patient relationship with the employee;

-- 67 of 112 --

Language stating “I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States
that the foregoing is true and correct.”
NOTE: No additional medical information may be sought from the employee, and
surgery is not required for the employee to have his or her records corrected to
reflect the new name and gender.

of the employee from the court order document and include a copy in the new
file along with the transcript.
Must request a history of health benefits actions processed through electronic
systems, for example, EBIS, My Pay, Personal Page, Employee Express or PostalEZ

Temporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC) for family members is documented as a
separate file from the OPF with the employee’s name on it. We suggest that the new
name be put on this file and it be maintained as is. If this is not possible, then the
TCC file should have the employee’s name redacted and maintained as an
independent file with no association with the new name of the employee.
Spouse Equity Act. Documentation of a former spouse’s entitlement to benefits must
travel with the employee’s file in order to ensure the former spouse’s entitlement up
through the retirement or death of the employee. The former name of the employee
may be redacted from the documents.
Continuation of Benefits. The spouse of the employee at the time of the employee’s
change in gender identity retains coverage as the employee’s spouse, as do the
employee’s children. The employee is entitled to benefits in the new gender and, if
applicable, new name.

Continuation of Benefits. The spouse of the employee at the time of the employee’s
change in gender identity retains coverage as the employee’s spouse, as do the
employee’s children. The employee is entitled to benefits in the new gender and, if
applicable, new name.
The requirements for coverage of foster children under FEGLI are the same as those for
coverage of foster children under the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB)
Program or the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP). If
there is already a certification on file for the FEHB or FEDVIP Program, the employee
does not have to complete a new certification for Option C coverage, unless the employee
is electing or increasing Option C because s/he acquires a foster child.
Original FEGLI documents needed that cannot be summarized on a transcript.
SF 2823 Designation of Beneficiary or its precursor SF 54
By law 8705 and regulation, FEGLI benefits are paid in a particular order. The first
in this list is the designated beneficiary.
The agency needs to strongly recommend to the employee that he/she complete a new
SF 2823 (if there is an old one with the old identity) but cannot force the employee to
do so.
If a new one is validly completed and filed, it will supersede previous ones on file.
If a new SF 2823 is not completed, by law any prior designation form in the sealed
OPF is the form used for payment. That form will need to be accessed at death before
any FEGLI payment can be made.
The transcript must state if there are any FEGLI designations forms on file and the
date of the form(s) if applicable. It should also be noted if there is no form on file.
OFEGLI needs the actual hard copy form to pay proceeds after death.
RI 76-10 Assignment of Life Insurance
The original RI 76-10 is maintained by the agency. The agency needs to know that it
is assigned since certain actions can be done by the assignee, not the insured. For
example, the insured cannot reduce coverage (except for Option C) after an
assignment. The agency sends the RI 76-10 to the OPM Retirement Office at the
time of retirement or to OFEGLI after death. It cannot be condensed to put on the
transcript. OFEGLI needs the actual hard copy form to pay proceeds after death.
Once the coverage is assigned the employee cannot assign again. However, the
assignee can assign the coverage to another party or back to the insured employee.
Court order for FEGLI purposes
The certified copy of a court order for FEGLI is maintained by the agency. It is not
interpreted by the agency. They send to the OPM Retirement Office at the time of
retirement or to OFEGLI after death. It cannot be condensed to put on the transcript.

Step 6 Merge transcript(s) and forms listed under step 5 to complete official personnel
folder.
Step 7 Authenticate the official personnel folder by signing at the end of the transcript.
If the agency recognizes eOPF as the official record, the paper transcript can then be converted
to an electronic format via electronic scanning into the electronic information system.
If the agency recognizes paper as the official record, file accordingly in agency filing system.
Step 8 Send OPF to NPRC
OPF of former “identity” is sealed and forwarded to the National Personnel Records Center
(NPRC). Folder should be double-wrapped along with introduction letter (see appendix B) and
sent to the following address:
National Archives and Records Administration,
National Personnel Records Center,
1411 Boulder Blvd, Valmeyer, IL 62295,
ATTENTION: Chief, Civilian Reference Branch (DO NOT OPEN IN
MAILROOM)
If the agency recognizes eOPF as the official record, the eOPF will be deactivated by the losing
agency and the eOPF will be forwarded to the NPRC instance within EHRI.
Step 9 Provide copy of new OPF to the employee via paper or electronically.
Former employees returning back to Federal Service
Step 1 Initiate search for OPF
Submit a Standard Form 127, Request for Official Personnel Folder (OPF) of former employee’s
former identity from the National Personnel Records Center:
National Archives and Records Administration,
National Personnel Records Center,
1411 Boulder Blvd, Valmeyer, IL 62295111
Step 2 Reconstruct OPF
Follow steps listed above regarding Change in Gender Identity.

Chapter 4: How to Reconstruct a Personnel Folder
Update 13, June 1st 2011 4-14
Former employees returning back to Federal Service and the official personnel
folder of the former identity cannot be located
Step 1 Request and verify proper documentation from the employee of the new identity.
Request that the employee submit acceptable evidence of identity in the new gender, if available,
and require evidence of the new name, if changed. State and foreign laws vary as to whether a
driver’s license or other State form of identification documents may be issued to reflect a gender
change. Possession of a valid passport in the employee's new name and gender is per se
acceptable evidence of the new name and gender, and no further evidence need be provided.
If evidence of change of gender in the identity documents is not obtainable because of state or
local requirements or any other reason, the personnel folder may still be reconstructed with the
employee's new name and gender to reflect a change in gender identity based on a medical
certification. To meet the medical certification requirement, the employee must obtain a signed
original statement, on office letterhead, from the attending medical physician (internist,
endocrinologist, gynecologist, urologist, or psychiatrist), that contains the following information:
Physician’s full name;
Medical license or certificate number;
Issuing state or other jurisdiction of medical license/certificate;
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) registration number assigned to the physician;
NOTE: If the attending physician does not have or provide a DEA number, the
employee’s request to reconstruct his or her personnel folder is to be
suspended for further clarification or verification of the physician’s bona
fides. Physicians in foreign countries, for example, would not have a DEA
number.
Address and telephone number of the physician;
Language stating that he/she is the attending physician for the employee and that he/she
has a doctor/patient relationship with the employee;
Language stating that the employee has had appropriate clinical treatment for transition to
the new gender (male or female); and
Language stating “I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States
that the foregoing is true and correct.”
NOTE: No additional medical information may be sought from the employee, and
surgery is not required for the employee to have his or her records corrected to
reflect the new name and gender.

Chapter 5: “Jointly-Owned” Personnel Folders
Update 13, June 1st 2011 5-1
Chapter 5 "Jointly-Owned" Personnel Folders
Recordkeeping agreements with the Office of Personnel Management
Chapter 1 of this Guide indicated OPM owned the personnel folder records agencies establish
under the Office’s recordkeeping authority. Legislative and Judicial Branch agencies, some
Executive Branch agencies such as the Central Intelligence Agency, and quasi-Government
agencies such as the U.S. Postal Service are not subject to OPM’s personnel folder
recordkeeping authority. These agencies have their own authority to establish and maintain
personnel records in a personnel folder.
Agencies maintaining records under OPM’s recordkeeping authority must establish a single
personnel folder for an employee's entire Federal employment history. This single folder may
contain personnel records established by agencies that have their own personnel folder
recordkeeping authority. We refer to such folders as jointly-owned personnel folders.
OPM has recordkeeping agreements with agencies that have their own recordkeeping authority.
The agreements describe what an agency maintaining a jointly-owned personnel folder is to do:
When the employee (subject of folder) separates
When there is a request for access to or disclosure of information from such a folder.
Who sends what
Chapter 2 of this Guide identifies the agencies that have agreements with OPM concerning
jointly-owned personnel folders. Chapter 2 also provides information on whether these agencies
will provide a personnel folder or an administrative folder. Chapter 6 of this Guide provides the
mailing addresses for these agencies.
Agency Responsibility
Once an agency receives, or establishes a jointly-owned Standard Form 66-C, Merged Records
Personnel Folder, that agency MUST:
Maintain a single personnel folder, containing all required records;
Use all records to make personnel decisions affecting the employee;
Permit the employee to review all records;
Provide a copy of all records to the employee, at the employee's request;
Provide a copy of records to anyone with the employee's written permission to receive or
review the records;

THE GUIDE TO PERSONNEL RECORDKEEPING
Chapter 5: “Jointly-Owned” Personnel Folders
Update 13, June 1st 2011 5-2
Disclose information from all records to agency employees and officials that need the
records to perform their duties; and
Remove or conceal all Social Security Numbers (SSNs) and other personally identifiable
information belonging to someone other than the subject that are displayed on records in
the Personnel Folder. ( i.e., lists covering more than one employee in a personnel action)
and provide a copy to the employee of the changed record
What agencies are not permitted to do
After an agency receives or establishes a jointly-owned personnel folder that agency MAY NOT:
Amend any records in the folder OPM does not own;
Destroy any records in the folder OPM does not own;
Remove any records that OPM does not own; except for Standard Form 181 and Standard
Form 256;
Adjudicate an appeal of an amendment to a record OPM does not own;
Enter into a settlement agreement on disposition of records OPM does not own; and
Disclose information to the public from any record OPM does not own.
Redact any SSNs on benefits forms or documents that involve payment of benefits, such
as FEGLI forms SF 2823, RI 76-10, FEHB forms SF 2809 and SF 2810, or court orders,
even if the SSNs are for someone other than the employee
Exception to disclosure prohibition
You must disclose information to:
The employee who is the subject of the record;
Agency officials and employees who use the employee records to perform their duties
Someone with the employee's written permission to review or receive a copy of his/her
records.
Refer requests to the "owner”
The agency maintaining a jointly-owned personnel folder may wish to initiate one or more of the
above-listed actions or may receive a request for such actions. In such situations, the
maintaining agency should refer the proposed action or the request to the agency that owns the
records. Refer to Chapter 6, Section 6-A, of this Guide for agency addresses.

Chapter 6: How to Respond to Request for Information
Update 13, June 1st 2011 6-1
Chapter 6 How to Respond to Requests for Information
Coverage
This chapter covers how to respond to a request for information contained in Employee Medical
Folders (EMF) and personnel folders (Official Personnel Folders and electronic Official
Personnel Folders (eOPFs), Merged Records Personnel Folders (MRPF), and Foreign Service
folders). These records come under the purview of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, and
can be identified within OPM’s Governmentwide systems of records. For example, this chapter
covers an employee’s request for a copy of his or her Official Personnel Folder. This chapter
does not cover requests for information developed from other records systems like payroll
records. For example, it does not cover a request for information on the amount of union dues
deducted from an individual’s salary.
Consult your privacy officer if you have any questions concerning access to or disclosure from
an OPF, MRPF, or Foreign Service Folder.
Request from Current Employee
OPM’s regulation on privacy procedures for personnel records are in Title 5, Code
of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 297
An employee's EMF or OPF must be made available to the employee for review upon request.
This is called access. Employees are required to present proper identification before the
personnel folder is provided to them. Employees reviewing their own folders must be
accompanied by a record custodian at all times. Employees may bring a personal representative
with them when they review their records. Employees may obtain copies of records in their
personnel folders. Observe agency policies with regard to any charges for copies.
If an access request is denied, the denial must be writing and will include a statement of the
reason for denial and the procedures available to appeal the denial. Refer to 5 CFR, Part 297.
Amendment requests
Amendment of personnel folders means the correction, addition, deletion, or destruction of a
specific portion of a folder. Request for amendment should include:
A precise identification of the record to be amended.
Identification of the specific material to be deleted, added or changed.
A statement of the reasons for the request, including all available material substantiating
the request.

-- 79 of 112 --

THE GUIDE TO PERSONNEL RECORDKEEPING
Chapter 6: How to Respond to Request for Information
Update 13, June 1st 2011 6-2
In processing amendment requests, the agency should ensure any amendments comply with the
Office of Personnel Management’s recordkeeping procedures and regulations in 5 CFR part 293
and 297.
Privacy Act amendments do not take the place of other appeal procedures established by law or
regulation, for example, adverse action appeals or classification appeals. Privacy Act
amendment procedures are designed to ensure the records reflects what occurred accurately, not
as a method to challenge an agency’s application of its personnel procedures.
Agencies have authority to process Privacy Act amendment requests from their employees as
long as those requests pertain to records generated under OPM’s recordkeeping authority. The
Office’s recordkeeping authority applies to Official Personnel Folder records documenting
employment in the competitive service, Senior Executive Service, or excepted service (Schedule
A, B, or C). Agencies do not have authority to amend records in Merged Personnel Records
Folders and Foreign Service folders created under another agency’s employment system.
Requests to amend records created under another employment system should be referred to the
agency that created the record. Refer to Section 6-A for more information on this
Certain administrative errors such as key stroke mistakes, misspelling etc. do not need to follow
the formal amendment process to be corrected if they do not substantially change the intent of
the record.
Review of denial of an amendment request
When an agency denies an employee's request to amend a personnel record, the employee should
be notified of the decision and informed that he or she may ask for an administrative review of
the decision in accordance with 5 CFR, part 297.301. The request for a review should be
directed to the Deputy Associate Director, Office of the Chief Information Officer, Office of
Personnel Management, 1900 E Street, NW, Room 7439, Washington, DC 20415-6000. The
request for a review should include a copy of the amendment request, the initial denial, and a
statement of the specific reasons why the initial denial is believed to be in error.
Request from Former Employee
Access requests
Former employees may receive copies of their own personnel and medical folders. Requests for
copies must be made in writing and should include: the full name (or names) used while
employed; social security number; date of birth; year of separation, and last employing agency
(if known).

The employee has authorized such access in writing; or
The release is specifically authorized by the Privacy Act; or
A routine use published in the Government-wide systems of records allows disclosure of
the records.
OPM has published notices for Government-wide systems of records that cover the Official
Personnel Folder (OPM/GOVT-1) and the Employee Medical Folder (OPM/GOVT-10). These
notices include descriptions of routine uses that allow release of records without the employee’s
prior written consent to specific officials outside the employing agency for specific purposes.
Some of the routine uses that apply to Official Personnel Folders allow records to be provided to:
The Merit Systems Protection Board, Office of Special Counsel or Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission in relation to appeals, investigations, and special studies;
Any Federal agency involved in a legal or administrative proceeding in which the
Government is a party;
Any Federal agency in relation to hiring an employee, issuing a security clearance, and
conducting a security or suitability investigation;
Federal, state, or local agencies for the adjudication of a claim under any retirement,
insurance, unemployment, or health benefits program.
Requests from officials outside the employing agency for records in a Merged Records Personnel
Folder or a Foreign Service folder not created under OPM’s recordkeeping authority should be
honored only if the requestor has the employee’s written consent to the release of the
information. All other requests should be referred to the agency that created the record.
When in doubt, check with the agency Privacy Act or Freedom of Information Officer when
unsure whether records may be disclosed.
Request from the Public
Introduction
Requests from the public for information from personnel and medical folders must be handled in
compliance with both the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a) and the Freedom of
Information Act (5 U.S.C 552). The Privacy Act restricts access to records in a system of
records. The Freedom of Information Act establishes the public's right to information contained
in Government records. Agencies are authorized to respond to requests for information from the
public on all Official Personnel Folders and Employee Medical Folders in their possession.
Merged Records Personnel Folders and Foreign Service Folders
Merged Records Personnel Folders and Foreign Service Folders contain records created under
employment systems outside OPM’s recordkeeping authority. Agencies should respond to

Position descriptions, identification of job elements, and those performance standards
(but not actual summary ratings) the release of which would not interfere with law
enforcement programs or severely inhibit agency effectiveness. Performance elements
and standards (or work expectations) may be withheld when they are so intertwined with
performance appraisals their disclosure would reveal an individual's summary rating.
These data may be withheld if the disclosure would reveal more about an individual on whom
information is sought than the listed items. Such disclosure would create a clearly unwarranted
invasion of personal privacy. The data may also be withheld if it is otherwise protected from
mandatory disclosure under an exception of the Freedom of Information Act. Refer to 5 CFR
293.311
Do not release
Do not provide an employee’s social security number or date of birth in response to a request for
information from the public.
When in doubt Check with the agency Privacy Act or Freedom of Information Officer when
unsure about what information from personnel records can be provided a member of the public.

individual are disclosed from an Office system of records except:
The employee who is the subject of the folder (the data subject);
Someone who has the employee’s prior written consent to receive the information;
Agency employees and officials using the records to perform their duties; and
The public as required by the Freedom of Information Act.
Content of accounting of disclosure
An accounting of disclosure must include the following information:
A brief description of the record disclosed.
Date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure.

Agencies may provide access to all records in Merged Records Personnel Folders and Foreign
Service folders to:
The employee who is the subject of the record;
Anyone who has the employee’s written authorization;

THE GUIDE TO PERSONNEL RECORDKEEPING
Chapter 7: Transferring Records
Update 13, June 1st 2011 7-1
Chapter 7 Transferring Records
Overview
When an employee leaves, the losing personnel office sends interagency personnel records to the
next Federal employer. If the employee is leaving Federal service, the losing personnel office
sends interagency personnel records to the National Personnel Records Center.
This chapter describes the procedures used to transfer interagency personnel records (personnel
folders, medical folders, performance records) to another personnel office or the National
Personnel Records Center.
Transferring Personnel Records
Background
The general rule is that each employee will have a single personnel folder which documents the
entire period of Federal civilian service. If long-term occupational medical records are created
during the employee’s service, those records will be in a single medical folder. The personnel
and medical folder "travel" with the employee throughout his or her entire Federal career. When
an employee separates from Federal service, the folders are stored by NARA, National Personnel
Records Center until retention requirements expire. Folders are retained for 65 years from date of
last separation from Federal employment. Chapter 7 – Transferring Records 7-2
Transferring Electronic Official Personnel Folders (eOPF)
The last employing agency (losing agency) will provide access to the official electronic folder in
an appropriate electronic format designated by the gaining agency or provide a paper format if
the electronic systems are not compatible or if the gaining agency is operating in a paper
environment. The losing agency, after completion and verification of a transfer of an electronic
personnel folder, must disable its access to the electronic version of the personnel folder to
ensure it complies with the requirements of the Privacy Act and implementing regulations. 5
U.S.C. 552a (b); 5 CFR 297.401.
Movement within the Federal government
Instructions on the transfer of personnel folders differ when the employee moves to a position:

Chapter 7: Transferring Records
Update 13, June 1st 2011 7-2
Transferring Records within the Agency Follow agency instructions
Follow agency instructions on transferring personnel records from one personnel office to
another in the same agency.
As a minimum, the following records must be transferred:
personnel folder (Official Personnel Folder, Merged Records Personnel Folder or Foreign
Service Folder) with all long-term (right side) documents;
all long-term medical documents;
performance records that include: Senior Executive Service Annual summary ratings
that are five years old or less; any appraisals prepared since the most recent annual
summary rating; and performance plans for each rating.
All Others Ratings of record that are four years old or less, including the performance
plan on which the most recent rating was based. Ratings of record include the evaluation
of the employee’s performance against the elements and standards plus the summary
level, pattern, and ending date of the appraisal.
Transferring Records to Another Agency
Requests
Request for an employee’s personnel records should be made in writing and should include
documentation of the employee’s appointment in the requesting agency. (A Standard form 50,
Notification of Personnel Action, or a Standard Form 52, Request for Personnel Action showing
the appointment and its effective date are the normal documentation sent when requesting
personnel records from another agency.)
The records should be sent to the new agency within 5 working days after receipt of the request.
If long-term records that should be transferred are not available, wait until those records have
been filed before sending the records. Notify the requester and explain the delay.
Transferring Folders
Normally, agencies will transfer personnel and medical folders to the next agency. Certain
performance records will be transferred in the personnel folder. The personnel folder may be an
Official Personnel Folder, Merged Records Personnel folder or Foreign Service Folder.
Employers who are outside OPM’s recordkeeping authority and do not transfer folders should
request a transcript of service rather than a folder.

Update 13, June 1st 2011 7-3
Preparing Folders
Follow these steps to prepare the personnel and medical folders for transfer.
Step 1 Action:
Check the personnel folder to make sure that it contains all the long-term documents that should
be in the folder and only the long-term documents authorized in Chapter 3. Make sure that all
documents are filed in chronological order.
Prior to transfer of a Personnel Folder (whether in a paper or electronic format) to an agency
under OPM’s recordkeeping authority, agencies must remove or conceal all Social Security
Numbers (SSNs) and other personally identifiable information belonging to someone other than
the subject that are displayed on records in the Personnel Folder. (i.e., lists covering more than
one employee in a personnel action) and provide a copy to the employee of the changed record.
Step 2 Action
Put the following documents and only those documents on the left or temporary side of the
personnel folder:
Record of Leave Data (standard Form 1150) or equivalent record of leave balances;
Documentation of indebtedness to the health benefits fund for pay periods that began for
September 30, 1996;
o Performance records. For Senior Executive Service employees, these are: annual
summary ratings that are 5 years old or less;
o Any appraisals prepared since the most recent annual summary rating;
o and performance plans for each rating.
o For all other employees, these are ratings of record that are 4 years old or less,
including the performance plan on which the most recent rating was based. Ratings of
record include the evaluation of the employee’s performance against the elements and
standards plus the summary level, pattern, and ending date of the appraisal. (Note:
For some agencies on eOPF, performance plans for transfer are indexed as
“PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL FOR TRANSFER”)
Step 3 Action
Put long-term occupational medical records in an Employee Medical Folder, standard Form 66-
D.
Step 4 Action: Send the folders to the next agency.
Follow agency instructions for documents that are not transferred to the next agency.

Chapter 7: Transferring Records
Update 13, June 1st 2011 7-4
Records erroneously left out
When long-term paper documents that should have been transferred to the next agency are
discovered after the folders have been mailed, send them immediately to the next agency. Attach
the documents to a cover letter that identifies the employee by name, the last four digits of
employees’ social security number, and date of birth. Reference the date the folder was originally
sent. Request for transcript in lieu of folders
Some employers who are outside of OPM’s recordkeeping authority should request a transcript
of service and other documents rather than personnel and medical folders. These employers are:
Architect of the Capitol
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
Central Intelligence Agency
Congressional Budget Office
District of Columbia Government
Federal Bureau of investigation
Tennessee Valley Authority
U.S. Botanical Gardens
U.S. House of Representatives.
The U.S. Senate sends transcript but receives folders when employees move from employment
under the Office’s recordkeeping authority to the Senate.
Preparing transcripts in lieu of folders
Take the following steps to prepare transcripts in lieu of folders.
Step 1 Action
Prepare the transcript summarizing all personnel actions processed during the employee’s
Federal career. Use the example in Section 7-A.
Step 2 Action

Preparing Folders
Follow these steps to prepare the personnel and medical folders for transfer.
Step 1 Action

be in the folder and only the long-term documents authorized in Chapter 3. Make sure that all
documents are filed in chronological order.
Step 2 Action
Put the following documents and only those documents on the left side of the personnel folder:
Record of Leave Data (standard Form 1150) or equivalent record of leave balances;
Documentation of indebtedness to the health benefits fund for pay periods that began for
September 30, 1996;
o Performance records. For Senior Executive Service employees, these are: annual
summary ratings that are 5 years old or less; any appraisals prepared sine the most
recent annual summary rating; and performance plans for each rating. For all other
employees, these are ratings of record that are 4 years old or less, including the
performance plan on which the most recent rating was based. Ratings of record
include the evaluation of the employee’s performance against the elements and
standards plus the summary level, pattern, and ending date of the appraisal. (Note:

Put long-term occupational medical records in an Employee Medical Folder, standard Form 66-
D. Oversized x-rays that will not fit in the folder may be microfiched and put in an envelope in
the folder or retained by the agency. If retained, the agency should put a note in the folder
explaining how to obtain the x-ray.
Step 4 Action
Send the folders to the National Personnel Records Center
Follow agency instructions for documents that are not transferred to the National Personnel
Records Center.

Retirement and Death Cases
When an employee retires or dies, there are special requirements for processing the separation.
The Office of Personnel Management’s Operating Manual, THE CSRS AND FERS
HANDBOOK FOR PERSONNEL AND PAYROLL OFFICES contains the processing
instructions for these actions. Follow these instructions and send the Official Personnel Folder
copy of all required documents with the application for benefits as specified in the Manual.
Records Erroneously Left Out
When long-term paper documents that should have been in the folder are discovered after the
folders have been mailed, send them immediately to the National Personnel Records Center.
Attach the documents to a cover letter that identifies the employee by name and date of birth.
Reference the date the folder was originally sent. Clearly identify the name, address, telephone
number and email address of the office submitting the records.
Notice to Employees
It is good practice to tell separated employees how they can request copies of documents in their
personnel and medical folders. A sample notice is on the next page of this Guide. Chapter 7 –
Transferring Records 7-8
Notice to Separated Employees - Retention of Personnel and Medical
Folders
Long-term records documenting individuals’ Federal careers are stored in the Official Personnel
Folder. The employee received copies of these records when they were created. When an
employee separates from the Federal service, the last employing agency sends the Official
Personnel Folder to the National Personnel Records Center for storage. Normally, the agency
sends the Folder within 120 days after the employee separates. The National Personnel Records
Center retains the folders for 65 years after separation. Former employees’ request for copies of
their personnel records must be in writing and should include:
the full name(or names) used while employed;
social security number; (Full, complete SSN)
written signature;
date of birth; and
if known, the year of separation and last employing agency.
Provide an address to send the response/copy of records as well as a day time telephone
number.

Since 1984 the Employee Medical Folder has been used to store long-term occupational medical
records that were created during an employee’s Federal career. These records do not include
records on claims filed under the Federal Employee’s Compensation Act. There may not be an
Employee Medical folder for each employee. When an employee for whom there are long-term
occupational medical records separates from Federal service, the last employing agency sends
the Employee Medical Folder to the National Personnel Records Center. The National Personnel
Records Center retains these Folders for 30 years after separation.
Former employees’ requests for copies of their Employee Medical Folder should be in writing
and include all identifying information (name, social security number, date of birth, written
signature) as well as an address to send the response/copy of records and a day time telephone
number.. These requests should be sent to:
National Personnel Records Center
Civilian Personnel Records
1411 Boulder Blvd,
Valmeyer, IL 62295
Sending Records Packaging
Personnel records should be securely packaged to be sure that they arrive in good condition.
Transcripts or individual folders may be sent in an envelope. Folders require envelopes or those
made from material similar to “Ty-Vek” are recommended.
Carriers
Employees may not be authorized to carry their own records to the next employer. Under the
Privacy Act, employees are entitled to copies of their records but the agency is responsible for
transferring the employee’s official records to the next employer.
Records may be sent by first class priority mail. Certified mail or commercial package shipping
service is the preferred method since these methods allow agencies to verify that the records
were delivered to the addressee.
